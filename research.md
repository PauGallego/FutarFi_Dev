## Futarchy:
- Dive deeper into how the market should behave, how does the price move? )with collateral, with oracle, with formula and automated (Uniswap-style)
- How manipulable is the market? (risks, manipulability, etc)
- Pros and cons of futarchy
- Real use cases (we will not implement it, but it must be documented)
- When you buy a token of a market what do you receive? shares? do you receive different shares depending on which market you bought in, or are they the same?
- How does PayPal stabilize its token

## Notes:

futarchy: a governance system where ends (values/objectives) are voted on and prediction markets decide the means (policies). The central idea is that if we can measure “national welfare,” then we can bet conditionally on whether a policy improves it or not, and adopt the policy that the market believes will increase that welfare the most.

- Aligns incentives: those who believe they have better information risk capital to correct prices and, in doing so, reveal that information.
- Reduces rhetoric: replaces speculative debates with prices that incorporate probabilities.
- Scales with data: the better you measure your objective, the more robust the decision.

If the proposal is accepted, then all trades on the rejection market would be reverted, but on the acceptance market after some time everyone would be paid some amount per token based on the futarchy's chosen success metric, and vice versa if the proposal is rejected. The market is allowed to run for some time, and then at the end the policy with the higher average token price is chosen.

**The Argument For**

futarchy fixes the "voter apathy" and "rational irrationality" problem in democracy, where individuals do not have enough incentive to even learn about potentially harmful policies because the probability that their vote will have an effect is insignifican  
in futarchy, if you have or obtain information that others do not have, you can personally substantially profit from it, and if you are wrong you lose money. Essentially, you are literally putting your money where your mouth is. (skin in the game)  
Second, over time the market has an evolutionary pressure to get better; the individuals who are bad at predicting the outcome of policies will lose money, and so their influence on the market will decrease, whereas the individuals who are good at predicting the outcome of policies will see their money and influence on the market increase

## Decisions:
- DAO generates proposals with N random tokens (within ranges) generated by an oracle.
- TWAP for prices (avoid market manipulation) Push/pull oracle.
- The losing market ultimately reverts (does not lose capital); only the winning market is exchanged 1:1 for the collateral (whoever invested earlier will earn more); even so there will be people who lose money.
- Automatic execution of the callData on the target contract.

---

## Contracts structure:
- **ProposalManager.sol** → contract managed by DAO’s, manage tokens.  
  generates Proposal.sol instances  
  Executes closed proposals  
  Manage the reverts and payments.
- **Proposal.sol** → each proposal creates 2 markets (Approve/Reject), stores all markets tokens from its proposal.  
  generates 2 Market.sol instances for each proposal
- **Market.sol** → All market logic
- Extra contract to manage the tx??¿¿ (buy, sell, etc…) or directly from Proposal.sol? → Look at polimarket

## Frontend:
- Next.js, tailwindCss, wagmi, viem
- Charting library?¿
- Connect wallet (rainbowkit)
- Create proposals
- Select existing proposals
- Buy/sell the approve/reject options.

## Hedera:

Hedera Hashgraph is a Layer 1 distributed ledger platform that does not use a traditional blockchain. It uses the Hashgraph consensus algorithm based on gossip and virtual voting. Hedera enables fast, secure, and scalable decentralized applications, smart contracts, and token creation.

Hedera offers high speed and scalability, processing thousands of transactions per second with fast finality. Transaction costs are very low compared to traditional blockchains. The network provides strong security through asynchronous Byzantine Fault Tolerant consensus. Governance is managed by a council of companies including Google, IBM, and Boeing, providing stability and institutional support. Hedera supports smart contracts written in Solidity and the Hedera Token Service (HTS) for creating fungible and non-fungible tokens.

To deploy on Hedera, create an account via the developer portal and obtain HBAR either through the testnet faucet or by purchasing on mainnet. Tokens can be created using HTS with SDKs in JavaScript, Java, or Go, connecting to testnet or mainnet and deploying with TokenCreateTransaction. Supply, divisibility, and optional freeze/KYC rules can be configured. Solidity contracts can be deployed via ContractCreateTransaction and interacted with using SDKs or Mirror Node APIs.

Transaction fees are typically very low, ranging from 0.0001 to 0.01 HBAR. A simple HBAR transfer costs around 0.0001 HBAR, HTS token transfers about 0.001 HBAR, and smart contract execution generally less than 0.01 HBAR depending on gas and storage. The market price of HBAR can be checked on platforms like CoinGecko or CoinMarketCap.

## Pyth:

Pyth Network is a decentralized oracle solution designed to provide high-fidelity, low-latency real-world data to blockchain applications. It sources data directly from first-party financial institutions, such as exchanges and trading firms, ensuring accurate and timely information for decentralized finance (DeFi) applications. Pyth's architecture utilizes a pull-based model, where data consumers request updates, allowing for efficient and scalable data delivery.

As of February 2024, Pyth has integrated over 400 price feeds into the Hedera network, offering developers access to real-time data for assets including cryptocurrencies, equities, foreign exchange pairs, commodities, and exchange-traded funds (ETFs). This integration empowers Hedera developers to build secure and efficient DeFi applications with permissionless access to critical financial data

To implement Pyth on Hedera, developers can utilize the Hedera Token Service (HTS) and Hedera's smart contract capabilities

Pyth distinguishes itself from other oracle solutions like Chainlink by focusing on high-frequency financial data sourced directly from primary market participants. This approach allows Pyth to offer faster and more accurate price feeds, which are particularly advantageous for DeFi applications that require real-time data.

## PYUSD :

PYUSD (PayPal USD) is a stablecoin issued by Paxos Trust Company, a fully licensed limited-purpose trust company regulated by the New York State Department of Financial Services (NYDFS).  
Each PYUSD token is fully backed by U.S. dollar deposits, U.S. Treasuries, and equivalent cash reserves. PYUSD can be bought or sold directly through PayPal at a fixed rate of 1.00 USD per PYUSD, ensuring price stability relative to the U.S. dollar. This 1:1 backing makes PYUSD a reliable digital asset for merchants and consumers.  
PYUSD can be transferred between PayPal and Venmo users in the United States without transaction fees, providing a fast and simple peer-to-peer payment option within PayPal’s ecosystem.  
PYUSD can also be used outside of PayPal’s platform because it is an ERC-20 token. This means it operates natively on the Ethereum mainnet and is compatible with any exchange, wallet, or protocol that supports ERC-20 tokens. Users can also send PYUSD on-chain between Ethereum wallets that support it, although standard Ethereum network fees apply.  
At present, PYUSD is officially supported only on Ethereum mainnet and Solana. However, since it is an ERC-20 token, it is technically possible to integrate or bridge it to other networks such as Hedera through interoperability solutions like Hashport. Although PYUSD is not currently deployed on Hedera, developers could implement a wrapped or bridged version by locking the original ERC-20 tokens on Ethereum and minting equivalent tokens on Hedera via the Hedera Token Service (HTS).

PYUSD behaves like any standard ERC-20 token. It can be integrated into applications using standard Ethereum libraries and tools. Developer examples for front-end and back-end integrations can be found here:
