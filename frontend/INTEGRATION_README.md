# Futarchy DeFi Protocol - Frontend Integration

## Overview
This implementation integrates the frontend with the deployed ProposalManager smart contract to fetch and display real proposal data for the connected wallet's admin address. The system now includes a comprehensive proposal creation form with advanced validation and transaction handling.

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Contract Integration
- **Contract Address**: `0xc351de5746211e2b7688d7650a8bf7d91c809c0d` (from latest deployment)
- **ABI Support**: Both ProposalManager and individual Proposal contract ABIs
- **Multi-chain Support**: Ready for different networks with constants file 
- **Dynamic Address Resolution**: Automatically resolves contract addresses based on connected chain

### 2. Real Data Fetching
- **Hook**: `useProposalsByAdmin` - Fetch# Futarchy DeFi Protocol - Frontend Integration

- **ABI Support**: Both ProposalManager and individual Proposal contract ABIs
- **Multi-chain Support**: Ready for different networks with constants file
- **Dynamic Address Resolution**: Automatically resolves contract addresses based on connected chain

### 2. Real Data Fetching
- **Hook**: `useProposalsByAdmin` - Fetches proposals where the connected wallet is the admin
- **Hook**: `useGetAllProposals` - Fetches all proposals for comprehensive listing
- **Public Client**: Uses wagmi's public client for efficient blockchain reads
- **Error Handling**: Graceful error handling for individual proposal failures

### 3. Proposal Creation System
- **Complete Form Interface**: Title, description, duration, collateral token, max supply, target address, and calldata
- **Advanced Validation**: Comprehensive client-side validation with multiple error display
- **Transaction Handling**: Full wagmi integration with transaction confirmation
- **User Feedback**: Loading states, success/error notifications, and transaction tracking

### 4. Enhanced User Experience
- **Wallet Connection**: Prompts users to connect wallet
- **Loading States**: Shows loading spinner while fetching data
- **Error States**: Displays error messages if data fetching fails
- **Transaction Feedback**: Real-time transaction status and confirmation

### 5. Form Validation Features
- **Comprehensive Validation**: All required fields validated before submission
- **Multiple Error Display**: All validation errors shown simultaneously as separate toast notifications
- **Field-Specific Validation**: Custom validation for addresses, numbers, and text fields
- **Network Validation**: Ensures contract availability on current network

### 6. Data Structure
Each proposal includes:
- ID, title, description
- Status (active, pending, executed)
- Creator address (admin)
- Creation timestamp
- Contract address
- Start/end times
- Duration in days (converted to seconds for contract)
- Collateral token configuration
- Max supply limits
- Target contract and calldata for execution

## Contract Methods Used

### Reading Data
- **`getProposalsByAdmin(address _admin)`** - Returns array of proposal contract addresses where the specified address is the admin
- **Individual Proposal Contract Calls** - Fetches detailed data from each proposal contract

### Writing Data
- **`createProposal()`** - Creates new proposals with the following parameters:
  - `title` (string): Proposal title
  - `description` (string): Detailed proposal description
  - `duration` (uint256): Duration in seconds (converted from days)
  - `collateralToken` (address): Token used as collateral
  - `maxSupply` (uint256): Maximum supply for the market
  - `targetAddress` (address): Target contract for execution
  - `calldata` (bytes): Encoded function call data

## Usage Workflows

### Viewing Proposals (Admin panel soon...)
When a user connects their wallet and visits the proposals page:
1. Gets the connected wallet address
2. Calls `getProposalsByAdmin` with that address
3. For each returned proposal address, fetches detailed proposal data
4. Displays proposals with appropriate status indicators and filtering

### Creating Proposals
When a user creates a new proposal:
1. Fills out the comprehensive form with all required fields
2. Client-side validation checks all fields simultaneously
3. If validation fails, all errors are displayed as separate toast notifications
4. On successful validation, calls `createProposal` contract method
5. Shows transaction progress and confirmation
6. Redirects to proposals list on success
